 * from here. `core.fx_rates` (kapa-core's migrations, same Supabase project)
 * is now refreshed by kapa-core's own `fx-refresh` Edge Function on a
 * pg_cron schedule, so a schema change there fails at kapa-core's build
 * time instead of at runtime in this app's cron, and kapa-vue's fx
 * correctness no longer depends on this app staying deployed.
